Many of us go through life taking our vision for granted. When our eyes are healthy we may not stop to appreciate the magic of seeing a grandchild’s smile or the flowers blooming in our garden. But around 80% of our memories are determined by what we see.1 Surely, we would want to do everything we can to take care of our eye health to keep making lasting memories. Around 80% of our memories are determined by what we see.1 Many of the complex structures of the eye do not undergo processes of biological renewal.2 That means, unlike the skin which is constantly renewing, there are parts of the eye that once they are fully developed, do not change. In fact, your eyeballs stay the same size from birth until death while your ears and nose continue to grow!1 This means it is really important to take a proactive approach to eye health.How Vision Works Light passes through the outer portion of the eye called the cornea. The cornea starts to focus the light and it passes through the black spot in the center of the eye called the pupil. The pupil changes size to allow more or less light in depending on the environment. On a bright sunny day the pupils will shrink in size, while in a dark, dimly-lit room the pupils will dilate to let in as much light as possible. The light then passes through the lens which further focuses it on the back of the eye called the retina. The lens changes shape depending on whether we are looking at objects up close or far away in the distance.","productURL":"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0773FKXF1","productImages":["https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1XChrd95lGr-bCsdMSsGUasBde57nUvi7?usp=sharing"],"img":"https://i.ibb.co/XyRKw29/71-RQ1-J2t-KAL-AC-SL1014.jpg"},{"category":"Health & Household","brand":"Convergence","productName":"Convergence Raw Whole Food Vitamin C - 100% Natural from Berries, Premium Antioxidants, Bioflavonoids & Polyphenols, Vegan, Real Immune Support, 60 Vegan Capsules","priceRange":"22-25","itemCode":"Item # CR016","quantity":"150","minimumOrder":"5","description":"Convergence Raw Whole Food Vitamin C - 100% Natural from Berries, Premium Antioxidants, Bioflavonoids & Polyphenols, Vegan, Real Immune Support, 60 Vegan Capsules","productURL":"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0C7143X8P?ref=myi_title_dp","productImages":["https://prnt.sc/esgS7aDOA9MP","https://prnt.sc/6HNvUJeLXCHz","https://prnt.sc/JH3iVWE-p_QL","https://prnt.sc/9wv3wCAJlvSp"],"img":"https://i.ibb.co/c8bcq0p/61-BRMt-Qu7-KL-AC-SL1500.jpg"},{"category":"Health & Household","brand":"Vi-Jon ","productName":"Vi-Jon Isopropyl 70% Alcohol, 32oz ( Pack of 2 ) ","priceRange":"2-4","itemCode":"Item # AJ017","quantity":"80","minimumOrder":"15","description":"First aid antiseptic that helps decrease germs in minor cuts and scrapes.

We tried virtually every product on the market. We tried a variety of blends.  At the end of the day, we realized that most magnesium products only had a few forms of the magnesium your body needs (at best)...  Plus, nobody had cracked the code on the right ratios of these different forms.  We realized we needed to create this product ourselves. We brought in one of the smartest formulators in the world to work with us...  And the result is Magnesium Breakthrough — it contains every key form of magnesium, in exactly the right ratio.  Our goal was not just to reverse deficiency, but also to transform your performance in EVERY key area.  Another key element that is missing in most formulations are the cofactors.  That's why we included cofactors like B6, manganese and monoatomic magnesium (a nutrient that's never been in any product, EVER) — to multiply the delivery of magnesium to every cell in your body.  The result: Magnesium Breakthrough is simply THE most complete, most potent, most performance-enhancing magnesium formula EVER created.","productURL":"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07YN973PR","productImages":["https://prnt.sc/1JBnDT29sjmg","https://prnt.sc/p_JxuTK33SRp","https://prnt.sc/W8rt5o-3lKa1","https://prnt.sc/twhl_aWWI9Oc"],"img":"https://i.ibb.co/zJWm1bz/7-Nzfnon-KSuecr-Kbfq-THCrg.png"},{"category":"Health & Household","brand":"Nervive","productName":"Nervive Nerve Care Pain Relieving Roll On, Fast Acting No-Mess Topical Pain Reliever with Maximum Strength Lidocaine and Menthol to Relieve Pain in Toes, Feet, Fingers, Hands, Legs & Arms, 2.5oz ","priceRange":"6-9","itemCode":"Item # NN023","quantity":"80","minimumOrder":"15","description":"Nervive comes from the World's #1 Selling Nerve Care Company‡ and we’ve taken our 50+ years of expertise in global nerve care to create NERVIVE PAIN RELIEVING Roll-On.

The family company now exports its herb specialties to more than 50 countries around the world. As a pioneer in organic herb cultivation, Ricolas close ties with culture and architecture were established early on in the companys history. These ties are further reinforced through the two Ricola foundations and its own art collection. Natural methods from Switzerland We give our herbs the time they need to grow. But once they have been harvested, we have to work quickly. Because fresh herbs are sensitive, it is not good to keep them in transit for long periods of time. This is why we cultivate and process our herbs right here in Switzerland. The plants are sent to the Herb Center at our production site in Laufen, where they are dried, cleaned, cut, stored, and mixed. Next, the natural essences and active ingredients are extracted from the herbs and mixed together with all the other ingredients. This mixture is cooked, molded into drops and pearls, and left to cool. In other words, every single step of the production process takes place in Switzerland","productURL":"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09BDBT2KG?ref=myi_title_dp","productImages":["https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1SEJ7Q27A2jKSQjYL9Dhi8a_IBs9qo76v?usp=sharing"],"img":"https://i.ibb.co/KwVQRV0/81gr-T4xx3t-L-AC-SL1500-1.jpg"},{"category":"Health & Household","brand":"swiffer","productName":"Swiffer PowerMop Wood Mopping Pad Refills for Floor Cleaning, 10 Count ","priceRange":"7-10","itemCode":"Item # BL127","quantity":"130","minimumOrder":"20","description":"Mop smarter with the Swiffer PowerMop Wood, an all-in-one mopping system that gives you a mop and bucket clean in half the time*.
